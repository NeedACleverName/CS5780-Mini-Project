# Project Goal
High level description: Using the discovery board and approximately 7 buttons, we will produce
a mini “piano” with five keys and some limited recording and looping functionality. The discovery
board will communicate with five buttons which will be hidden below 3D printed piano keys (or
something similar). These buttons will produce interrupts which cause predetermined tones to
play over a speaker connected to the board. An additional button will determine a period over
which the “key” presses will be recorded and then played back on a loop, enabling different
patterns of sounds to be played over top of one another. A third functionality will produce an
export of the information necessary to reproduce the musical tones on a separate device, or at a
different time. Additionally, we will include a potentiometer that alters the saved frequency
values for the tones produced by each key, enabling “tuning” of the keys to produce a larger
variety of music.
